This repository project will showcase my skills in rebuilding the google homepage from scratch using only the google homepage as a reference and not the code itself

Day 1 (1/21/21): I used the word google as text and set the color but I realized that the google logo was a picture

Day 2-4 (1/22-1/25/21): I set the google logo image in the middle and created the text box and centered it as well. On this fourth day, I will round the corners of the text box and create the two bottons: Google Search and I'm Feeling Lucky (I'm also trying to decide if I want to animate the I'm Feeling Lucky button - but for right now, I will attempt a barebones version of the homepage)
